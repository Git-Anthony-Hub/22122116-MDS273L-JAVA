About The Java Program:
So the program takes some inputs like name, roll no, state, gender. Then if the gender is 'm' then the programs identifies it through if-else code and prints 'Male' and if its 'f' then program prints 'female'.
Further the program identifes the zone to which the state belongs and prints the zone. The program does this through switch case code.
